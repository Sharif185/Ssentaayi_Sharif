## Key Findings

1. Fertilizer Drivers:
   - Soil pH shows strongest influence (r=0.085)
   - Humidity has minimal impact (r=0.017)
   - Soil moisture correlation negligible (r=-0.0009)

2. Crop Moisture Levels:
   - Wheat: 47.36% (highest)
   - Maize: 44.95%
   - Beans: 44.34%
   - Tomatoes: 44.02% 
   - Lettuce: 42.93%

3. High-Temp (>30°C) Irrigation:
   - Tomatoes: 18.92mm → 48.65% moisture
   - Wheat: 18.65mm → 44.09%
   - Lettuce: 16.30mm → 42.66%

## Actionable Recommendations

• Soil Management:
  - Prioritize pH testing before fertilization
  - Conduct controlled pH adjustment trials

• Irrigation Adjustments:
  - Tomatoes: Maintain volume, shift to morning watering
  - Wheat: Increase frequency during heat waves
  - Lettuce: +10-15% water in high temps, consider shade nets

• Monitoring:
  - Install IoT soil sensors in wheat and tomato fields
  - Implement moisture-based irrigation triggers
